# Node.js Google Geolocation Example

This is a simple Node.js project that demonstrates how to use the Google Geolocation API to obtain addresses based on latitude and longitude coordinates.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- Node.js installed on your machine.
- A Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project with the Geocoding API enabled and an API Key. If you don't have one API Key, you can see more here: [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) into "APIs & Services" > "Credentials."

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hrcodes/geocode_google.git
   cd geocode_google
   ```

2. Install the project

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Add a .env file with your API KEY:

   ```bash
   GOOGLE_APIKEY=YourApiKeyHere
   ```

4. Run the project

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
